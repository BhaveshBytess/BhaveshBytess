## Bhavesh 👋  
**AI / ML Research Engineer — Graph Neural Networks · Financial Fraud · LLM Systems**

I work on **research-driven machine learning systems** where correctness, reproducibility,  
and real-world constraints matter more than benchmarks alone.

My current focus is **financial fraud detection using temporal and heterogeneous graphs**,  
and **LLM-based pipelines for structured knowledge extraction**.

I am particularly interested in **why models fail**, not just when they succeed.
