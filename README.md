# Hi, I'm Bhavesh 👋  

### **Applied ML Engineer | Research-Driven Systems · Graph ML · Intelligent Products**

I build **machine learning systems and products** grounded in research thinking,  
but designed with **real-world constraints, deployment realities, and failure modes** in mind.

## 🚀 Current Direction
I have done deep work in **Graph Neural Networks and financial fraud research**,  
and I now focus on **building end-to-end ML products** — from problem framing  
and system design to modeling, evaluation, and iteration.

> *I care less about models in isolation and more about systems that actually work.*

Research remains my **foundation** — product impact is the goal.

## 🧠 Technical Interests
- Applied Machine Learning & ML Engineering  
- Graph-based Learning (Fraud, Anomalies, Structured Data)  
- Predictive & Industrial ML Systems  
- Evaluation-driven AI and failure analysis

## 📌 Selected Work (Research + Systems)

| Project | Focus | Notes |
|------|------|------|
| **[TRDGNN](https://github.com/BhaveshBytess/TRDGNN)** | 🔴 **Flagship:** Temporal GNNs | Bitcoin fraud detection with multiple architectural contributions and publication-ready analysis |
| **[Research-Paper-Analyzer](https://github.com/BhaveshBytess/Research-Paper-Analyzer)** | 🧠 LLM Product | PDF → structured JSON with grounding, numeric consistency, and latency constraints |
| **[GraphTabular-FraudFusion](https://github.com/BhaveshBytess/GraphTabular-FraudFusion)** | 📉 Failure Analysis | Rigorous negative-result study showing when graph embeddings do *not* improve XGBoost |

These projects represent my **research backbone** — the same rigor I now apply to product-focused ML systems.

## 📐 How I Think
> Research teaches *why*.  
> Engineering decides *what survives reality*.  
> Products demand *both*.

I optimize for **clarity, correctness, and long-term usefulness** — not hype.
